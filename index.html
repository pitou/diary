          Intro
        </div>

        <div class="introText">
          On <strong>August 10, 2021</strong>, I reached the last page of my diary, which I started writing on the <strong>first day of 2020</strong>.
          <br />
          I thought it would be interesting to try to <strong>represent the structure of its pages</strong> using simple design choices.
        </div>

        <div class="introText flex">
          <div>
            The rules are:
            <ul>
              <li>each <strong>block</strong> inside a page represents a single <strong>writing session</strong>, on a certain date</li>
              <li>the <strong>height</strong> of each block is proportional to the actual space that it occupies on the original page</li>
              <li>if a writing session spans over <strong>multiple pages</strong>, the upper and/or lower side of its related block will be a <strong>dashed line</strong>, to express continuation</li>
              <li>if I skipped writing for one or more days, at the top of the block you will see a <strong>colored header</strong>; the darker the color, the more days were skipped</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            Here's a two-page example:
            <div class="imageContainer">
              <img src="public/diary/example.png" alt="example" />
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="introText">
          I'm thinking about an alternative view in which the <strong>number of rows</strong> in a block is taken in consideration instead of its height;
          sooner or later I will implement it.
          Being a quick experiment made in a few days, honestly I do not expect this project to grow further than that, but who knows.
          <br />
          Anyway, thank you for visiting! See you in the future for the analysis of volume two :)

        <div class="introText">
          Each page is rendered dynamically using <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D3.js</a>,
          and its content reflects some data present in an external CSV file.
