        <div class="introText">
          On <strong>August 10, 2021</strong>, I reached the last page of my diary, which I started writing on the <strong>first day of 2020</strong>.
          <br />
          I thought it would be interesting to try to <strong>represent the structure of the pages</strong> using simple design choices.
          <br />
          The rules are:
          <ul>
            <li>each section inside a page represents a single <strong>writing session</strong>, on a certain date</li>
            <li>the height of each section is proportional to the actual space that it occupies on the original page</li>
            <li>if a writing session spans over multiple pages, the upper and/or lower side of a single section will be a dashed line, to express continuation</li>
            <li>if I skipped writing for one or more days, at the top of the section you will see a colored block; the darker the color, the more days were skipped</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          I'm thinking about an alternative view in which the <strong>number of rows</strong> in a section is taken in consideration instead of its height;
          sooner or later I will implement it. Being a quick experiment made in a few days, honestly I do not expect this project to grow further than that, but who knows.
          <br />
          Anyway, thank you for visiting! See you in the future for the analysis of volume two :)
